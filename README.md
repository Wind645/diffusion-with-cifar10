# diffusion-with-cifar10
This is a small implementation of the diffusion model trained on cifar-10. The UNet is designed manually with pytorch and mainly consists of 2 conv layers and 2 transpose conv layers. I didn't pay a lot of efforts on the architecture of the UNet, as I just want to reproduce a simple diffusion model for practise.
I have finished the code in UNet and the noise schedular, as for the left, I get bored with them so my good friend copilot helped me.
